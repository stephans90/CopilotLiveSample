# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for running projects at OctoAcme, from initial idea through release and continuous improvement.

## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme follows a **customer-first, iterative delivery** approach to project management. Our process emphasizes:

- **Customer value**: Prioritize customer needs and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments frequently
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead (PdM)
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and continuous learning

### Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs and approvals

### Project Lifecycle
1. **Initiation**: Problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Scope, resources, milestones, dependencies
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, iterate
4. **Release**: Deploy, verify, announce
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings and next steps
